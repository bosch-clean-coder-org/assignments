# Assignments

Welcome to the Clean Code Leader course entry!

The intention of this exercise is to check your participation. You would need some exploration to get used to GitHub,
[Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), gates and workflows.

Accept the assignment in a language of your choice -
you will get a repo of your own. Notice failing GitHub Actions.

Go ahead and fix them on the main branch itself. Have fun :)
